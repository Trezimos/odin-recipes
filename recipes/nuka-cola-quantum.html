    <h2>How to Make Nuka Cola Quantum</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 16-ounce can Monster "Ultra Blue" energy drink</li>
            <li>1 cup Gatorade "Icy Charge"</li>
            <li>2 cups Mountain Dew "Voltage"</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Measure Monster into a punch bowl.</strong> Pour a 16-ounce can of Monster "Ultra Blue" into a punch bowl/serving pitcher.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the Gatorade to the bowl.</strong> Pour 1 cup of Gatorade "Icy Charge" into the punch bowl/serving pitcher. Pour slowly to prevent the Monster from fizzing up a lot.</li>
            <li><strong>Pour in the Mountain Dew and stir the Nuka Cola Quantum.</strong> Pour 2 cups of Mountain Dew "Voltage" into the the punch bowl/serving pitcher. Take a long spoon and slowly stir the mixture until the liquids are combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve the Nuka Cola Quantum.</strong> Set out serving glasses so guests can help themselves to this fizzy drink. If you'd like to put the cola in bottles, use a funnel to pour in into the bottles and serve them before the Nuka Cola Quantum loses its carbonation.</li>
                <ul><li>If you choose to bottle the Nuka Cola Quantum, consider setting out some old Nuka Cola Caps.</li></ul>
         </ol>
