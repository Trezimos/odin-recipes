    <h2>How to Make Classic Nuka Cola</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 16-ounce bottle cream soda</li>
            <li>1 16-ounce bottle Coca-Cola</li>
            <li>1 16-ounce bottle Mountain Dew, Mello Yello, or Sprite</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Measure Coca-Cola into a punch bowl.</strong> Pour a 16-ounce bottle of Coca-Cola into a punch bowl/serving pitcher. If you don't have Coca-Cola, substitute any cola flavored soft drink. Use chilled Coca-Cola to keep the drinks cold.</li>
                <ul><li>You can easily double or triple this recipe as long as you keep the proportions the same. Just use a larger punch bowl.</li></ul>
            <li><strong>Add the Mountain Dew to the bowl.</strong> Pour a 16-ounce bottle of Mountain Dew, Mello Yello, or Sprite into the punch bowl/serving pitcher. Pour slowly to prevent the soda from fizzing up a lot.</li>
            <li><strong>Pour in the cream soda and stir the Nuka Cola.</strong> Pour a 16-ounce bottle of cream soda into the the punch bowl/serving pitcher. Take a long spoon and slowly stir the mixture until the liquids are combined.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve the Nuka Cola.</strong> Set out serving glasses so guests can help themselves to this fizzy drink. If you'd like to put the cola in bottles, use a funnel to pour in into the bottles and serve them before the Nuka Cola loses its carbonation.</li>
                <ul><li>If you choose to bottle the Nuka Cola, consider setting out some old Nuka Cola Caps.</li></ul>
         </ol>
